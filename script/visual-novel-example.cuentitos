You find yourself looking at the pond.
It's greener than yesterday, with some sort of glow.
baz: What are you looking at?
  * I'm looking at the glow under the lake.
    simon: I'm looking at the glow in the lake, it was not here yesterday, was it?
    baz: I don't think so.
  * I'm looking at my reflection, what do you think?
    simon: I'm looking at my reflection in the lake.
    baz: Beautiful isn't it?
